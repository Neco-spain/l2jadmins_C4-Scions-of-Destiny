Oh, I see... It's true that it's quite costly just to leave Talking Island, let alone to visit Giran, which is so far away! I should know! My travels to the mainland were more costly than you can imagine!<br>
But you're right! Travel is essential to your education, and every young man should see Giran! You've come at the right time. I recently received a request from Sir Collin Windawood, he's looking for a reliable young man. You seem to fit the bill!<br>
Take this <font color="LEVEL">letter</font> to the Archon, <font color="LEVEL">Sir Collin Windawood</font>. Tell him that I sent you, he'll probably sponsor your trip! He's concerned about the future of not only Talking Island, but of the entire Kingdom of Aden!<br>
You'll hardly ever find the Archon at home... He tends to wander about the countryside. You may find him walking near the  <font color="LEVEL">Obelisk of Victory</font>.
