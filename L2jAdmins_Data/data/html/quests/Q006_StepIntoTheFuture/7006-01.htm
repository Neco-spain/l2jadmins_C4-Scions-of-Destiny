I'm very lucky that my job allows me to travel extensively!<br>
From Aden to Giran to Heine, each one is amazing and beautiful in its own way! I've met many interesting people in my travels...<br>
But naturally, I returned to Talking Island! It's my home, and the most comfortable place to me. I do hope to travel again in the future, however!<br>
You're a traveler, you know what I'm talking about, right?<br>
