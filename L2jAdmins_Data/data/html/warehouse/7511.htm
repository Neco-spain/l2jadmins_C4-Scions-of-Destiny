<html><body>Warehouse Chief Gesto:<br>
I am Warehouse Chief Gesto of the Iron Gate Guild here in Giran. Our motto is "We sell anything to anyone, anywhere." We travel to frozen wastes, deserts, even volcanic zones, to create prosperity for our Dwarven tribe. Who else can claim that?<br>
But you're a new face around here, I see. What can I do for you?<br>
