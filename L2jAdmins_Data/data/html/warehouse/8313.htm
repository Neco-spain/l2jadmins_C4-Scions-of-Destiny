<html><body>Warehouse Keeper Runin:<br>
Over 50 years in the warehouse business have taught me that fortune can be fleeting. For example, until last year, the commerce of the Rune area was entirely controlled by the Van Halter Family. But now, control has been seized by the Benedictine Commerce Guild.<br>
Anyone thinking about opening a business in a dangerous village like this should at least know that much. Of course, I know what I'm talking about!<br>
