It is only natural that in order to create a duel sword, you'd need the two single swords which being combined. Of course, I charge a small fee since I'm not working for charity and all. And heating costs for stoking the fire are pretty steep...</td></tr><tr><td>As you may know, it is not easy to handle the sword unless the balance between both hands is equal.</td></tr><tr><td>That means that only swords of identical grades can be combined...</td></tr><tr><td>Plus, keep in mind that enchanted weapons lose their effect once they are combined with another sword.</td></tr><tr><td>My, am I worrying for nothing? Well, I'm sure you know all this.<br>
Here, select the sword that you wish to combine from the following list.<br>
