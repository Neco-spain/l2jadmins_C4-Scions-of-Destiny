Dark Knight Mordred:<br>
I understand your feelings of injustice! You must be very angry! I know I would be! I've never forgiven anyone who wronged me!<br>
Evil must be met by justice! All who sin against you should be annihilated!<br>
Don't give it a second thought! Your anger and thirst for revenge are natural! You shouldn't hold your feelings inside yourself like that.<br>
