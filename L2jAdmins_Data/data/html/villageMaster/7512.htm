 Head Blacksmith Kusto:<br>
 I am Head Blacksmith Kusto of the Black Anvil guild, here in Giran. Our guild differs from the Iron Gate in that it doesn't exist solely to make a profit. Even if we don't earn money, there are some things that must be done. Don't you think it is important in its own way if my skills can bring happiness to others?<br>
 Well, but what has brought you here? I would be more than happy to assist you if I can.<br>
