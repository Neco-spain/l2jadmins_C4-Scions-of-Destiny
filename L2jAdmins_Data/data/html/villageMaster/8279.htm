High Priest Gregory:<br>
Greetings, my child. It's nice to see someone with so much enthusiasm at a difficult time like this. <br>
 Goddard has been going through some trying times lately. Varka Silenos and Ketra Orcs are on the verge of war. And now I hear that Valakas, the fire dragon, has awoken... We desperately need young warriors like you!<br>
Times like these are when we disciples of the gods must be vigilant and persevere!<br>
