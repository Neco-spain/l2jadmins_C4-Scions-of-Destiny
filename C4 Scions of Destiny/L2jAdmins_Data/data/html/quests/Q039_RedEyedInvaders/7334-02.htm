<html><body>Guard Babenco:<br>
I just received a report that a large army of savage <font color="LEVEL">Maille Lizardmen</font> is gathering in the western section of Gludio Castle Town. They're not satisfied staying on the plains.<br>
<font color="LEVEL">Captain Bathis</font> is recruiting militiamen in Gludio, and we need all the help we can get.<br>
You seem worthy. Would you join us?<br>
