Have you heard?  As of Chronicle 4, a brand new, affordable teleportation option is made available for the exclusive use of the Noblesse!  <br>
In celebration of the dawn of a new era, we're offering everyone a chance to utilize this teleportation option normally reserved for the Noblesse.  You are invited to <font color="LEVEL">teleport to nearby hunting grounds for the same price charged to a Noblesse</font>. <br>You should try it out!<br>
